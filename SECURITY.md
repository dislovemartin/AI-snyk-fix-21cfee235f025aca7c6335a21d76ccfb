1. **Legal Safe Harbor**:
   - Add a Safe Harbor Clause: Include a statement that protects researchers from legal action when they report vulnerabilities in good faith and follow the policy guidelines.
     - Example: "We will not take legal action against individuals who discover and report security vulnerabilities responsibly, in accordance with this policy."

2. **Confidentiality Assurance**:
   - Protect Reporter Privacy: Assure reporters that their personal information and report details will be kept confidential and used only for remediation purposes.
     - Example: "All reports will be handled confidentially, and we will not share your information without your consent."

3. **Secure Communication Channels**:
   - Provide Encryption Options: Offer a method for securely sending sensitive information, such as a PGP key or secure submission form.
     - Example: "For secure communication, please use our PGP key available at [link] when sending emails."

4. **Bug Bounty Information** (if applicable):
   - Incentivize Reporting: If you have a reward program, mention it to encourage more researchers to report vulnerabilities.
     - Example: "We offer rewards for valid vulnerability reports as part of our bug bounty program. Details can be found at [link]."

5. **Clarify Scope**:
   - Define In-Scope and Out-of-Scope Vulnerabilities: Specify which types of vulnerabilities are covered and which are not, to focus efforts on significant security issues.
     - Example: "The following areas are in scope: [list]. The following are out of scope: [list]."

6. **Versioning Details**:
   - Include Release Dates: Adding release dates for each version can help users identify if they're on a supported version more easily.
     - Example:

       | Version | Release Date | Supported          |
       | ------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
       | 5.1.x   | 2023-08-15   | :white_check_mark: |
       | 5.0.x   | 2022-12-10   | :x:                |
       | 4.0.x   | 2021-06-05   | :white_check_mark: |
       | < 4.0   | Before 2021  | :x:                |

7. **Response Commitment**:
   - Set Clear Expectations: While you've outlined response times, reiterate your commitment to resolving issues promptly.
     - Example: "We are committed to resolving all verified vulnerabilities promptly and will keep you informed throughout the process."

8. **Acknowledgment Preference**:
   - Respect Anonymity Requests: Clearly state that you respect the reporter's preference regarding public acknowledgment.
     - Example: "We appreciate your contribution and, with your consent, would like to acknowledge your efforts publicly. If you prefer to remain anonymous, please let us know."

9. **Update Notification**:
   - Inform Users of Fixes: Explain how and when users will be notified about security fixes.
     - Example: "Security fixes will be announced in our release notes and through our official communication channels."

10. **Contact Verification**:
    - Ensure Contact Information is Accurate: Make sure that the provided email address is monitored and that emails are responded to promptly.
      - Example: "Our security team is available at **security@yourproject.com**, and we ensure prompt attention to all reports."
