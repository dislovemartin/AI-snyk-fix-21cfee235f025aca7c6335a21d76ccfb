# Step 1: Inspect and Execute `ai_platform_setup.sh`
# Navigate to the ai_platform_setup directory and make the setup script executable, then run it.
cd ai_platform_setup
chmod +x ai_platform_setup.sh
./ai_platform_setup.sh

# Step 2: Run Docker Compose
# Check if Docker Compose is set up to manage the platform services, then bring up services using docker-compose.yml.
# This command assumes Docker is installed and running on the host system.
docker-compose up -d

# Step 3: Execute `automated_deploy.sh`
# Run the automated deployment script, which may deploy services to a Kubernetes cluster or other orchestration platforms.
chmod +x automated_deploy.sh
./automated_deploy.sh

# Step 4: Review Logs and Status
# Check the status of Docker containers and deployment output to confirm successful setup.
docker ps
